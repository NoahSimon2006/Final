# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Cruel Pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
We are creating a pong game that is unfair to the player.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The pong game becomes unfair to the player by making the opponont's paddle bigger and they hit the ball faster and the player 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Yaseen Benharats tut17587@temple.edu Elmira Talebianaraki and Kora Sen
Afzal Shaik ashaik@temple.edu Elmira Talebianaraki and Kora Sen

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A basic pong game


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A basic pong game that doesn't have any errors or glitches

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A pong game with all added features and doesn't have any errors or glitches


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We need a basic understanding of game concepts and understand how pong works by thinking about how each part of the game works with each other, we have one of us work on the paddles, one of us work on the ball physics, and one work on AI.
We then need to learn how to use love and understand from the tutorial how to make it our own and how to implement our features into the game.
